# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a guide to the Edx Front End Development Bootcampt Prework module.

It serves as a quick reference for many of the useful tips and workflows presented in the module.
Creating this project gave me the opportunity to put into practice the techniques I was learning - plus, I no longer need to keep track of reams of notes.
I found the information detailing the Git process particularly useful.
